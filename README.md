# Throxy

Here are the steps I followed to build this app:

[x] Created a new Next.js app from a template
[x] Removed unused files
[x] Added a models interface based on the data provided
[ ] Deploy to Vercel and connect with Github
[ ] Build the UI and seperate out components
[ ] Add the filters to the page route
[ ] Set up Supabase
[ ] Build the API routes
[ ] Build the data fetching logic
[ ] Build the upload route
[ ] Link with OpenAI to clean the data

## Getting Started

1. Copy over the .env.example file to .env and fill in the values
2. You can run the app with `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
